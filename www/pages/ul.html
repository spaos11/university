          <br>

          After the ruins of World War II, Dagupan City rose to become one of the major economic, political and socio-cultural centers of Northern Luzon. At the core of this development were the academic institutions that served to produce the prime movers of society. <br><br>
In that fateful year of 1948, Atty. Luis F. Samson, Sr. gathered his friends: Atty. Liberato Ll. Reyna, Sr., Dean Basilio Fernandez and Servillano Romasanta. Together, they designed the blueprint of the then Luzon College of Commerce and Business Administration (LCCBA). They endeavored with zeal and energy to establish in this part of the country a system of education, genuinely Filipino, through the instrumentality of the LCCBA. <br><br>
Inspired by Dr. Samson’s initiative, these pioneers in the field of education dared think of country and national ideals at a time when patriotism was not paid a high premium and love for truth and knowledge were not deemed as virtues of considerable values.
That powerful glow which was lit in 1948 contributed to the vanguard of a movement that was bound to grow and develop with the passing of years. In 1952, LCCBA was renamed Luzon Colleges (LC). From the initial enrolment of 243, LC held as many as more than 16,000 students at the onset to the middle part of the 80’s. <br><br>
Recognizing its solid achievements and capabilities, the Commission on Higher Education granted university status to the Luzon Colleges in 2002. After more than half a century, the founders’ dream was finally fulfilled and the University of Luzon (UL) took its place in the rich history of Northern Luzon. <br><br>
For nearly six decades, UL reigned as one of the top educational institutions in Northern Luzon. It chalked up a string of topnotchers in the PRC Licensure Examinations including 9 first placers, 68 second to 10th placers and 36 11th to 20th placers in the last 20 years. This is on top of a consistently impressive passing rate. <br><br>
UL’s high spirits is strongly demonstrated by its major achievements in the last 13 years: Universityhood in 2002, Deregulated status in 2003 and one of the Top 10 higher education institutions in the entire country, the only provincial HEI to have made it in Region 1, awarded by the Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA) with the highest number of accredited academic programs, also in 2003. This was replicated in 2004 when UL was again awarded by PACUCOA as one among the very few HEIs in the country with the highest number of accredited programs and majors, the only one accorded such honor and distinction from Pangasinan and Northern Luzon. <br><br>
A few years after, Criminology (2006), Teacher Education programs (Elementary and Secondary), Business Administration and Liberal Arts (2007) were granted Level III-Reaccredited Status by PACUCOA.
In May 2008, the UL College of Criminology was granted its much-coveted Center of Excellence (COE) status by the Commission on Higher Education, the first in the entire Philippines to be so honored. Inspired by this turn of event, the College applied for Level IV Accreditation status from November 14-15, 2008 and was granted this highest accreditation status in November 25, 2008 by the PACUCOA. This impressive feat captured the imagination of all criminology schools in the country with the UL Collge of Criminology as the leading light in Criminology Education. Also, in 2008, the UL College of Education was certified and deputized as a Center of Training in Teacher Education by the Commission on Higher Education, Department of Education and the Professional Regulation Commission. <br><br>
All these educational thrusts gained fruits when in March 11, 2009, the University received the confirmation from CHED that our institution is finally elevated to full autonomy. With this, UL has finally seen the realization of its immediate transition as the first and only autonomous university to be given the seal of distinction and accolade as an excellent higher education institution in Region 1 “for its meritorious accomplishments, adherence to quality assurance, commitment to public responsibility and accountability as a higher education institution”, by no less than CHED. <br><br>
Very recently, in December 2014, UL was again awarded for the fourth time by PACUCOA as the only HEI North of Manila with the highest accredited academic programs. To date, UL has 4 academic programs enjoying Level IV accredited status: Liberal Arts, Business Administration, Elementary and Secondary Education. The Criminology program of the University enjoys Level IV Reaccredited status and was just recently renewed by PACUCOA. Nursing is Level III accredited. On the other hand, HRM and Computer Studies are now Level II accredited along with 5 graduate programs enjoying the same level of accreditation: MPA, MAN, MBA, MAEd and MS Criminology. Up for Level I accreditation are DPA, Ph.D. and DA while Tourism and I.T. are currently enjoying Level 1 status. <br><br>
Presently, the Colleges of Education, Liberal Arts and Business Administration are eyeing for Center of Excellence (COE) Status and the College of Computer Science for Center of Development (COD).
UL’s aggressiveness and dynamism in the accreditation of all its academic programs is directed at further sustaining and enhancing the momentum we have painstakingly established as the most Accredited University North of Manila and is now ready for Institutional Accreditation. <br><br>
UL, true to its mission-vision, constantly aims for quality and excellence and prides itself in having carved a permanent niche in the consciousness of the public as a quality institution of higher learning. The University is now the most accredited university North of Manila — the highest in Region 1.
